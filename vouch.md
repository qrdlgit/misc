NewsNation interviews with David Grusch / Whistleblower - https://www.youtube.com/@NewsNation/search?query=ufo%20whistleblower


I am skeptical of David Grusch, because when he talks he doesn't caveat carefully about what he's been told is true versus what he's verified personally.  He also claims to want to be an 'opinion leader'.  

But I'm also fascinated by the chorus of reasonably credible voices supporting him and/or his claims.  

For that reason, I am keeping an updated list of folks who vouch for either David, his claims, or both.

I believe most presidents have been circumspect in their denials around this.  Considering how often they lie to get elected though, not sure it's relevant either way. Carter is in hospice, and he once did promise that he would get the truth out to Americans, but walked it back after getting elected. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter_UFO_incident

If I am missing anyone here, let me know in issues.  I'll try to keep it updated as more voices show up.

Scenarios:

1. David is telling the truth, but some combination of the following
   1. He misunderstood / misjudged some of his sources
   2. Some of his sources are confabulating, but not purposely and misunderstood what they know/saw
   3. Some of his sources are purposely confabulating for reasons of
      1. Trying to shift the burden of proof to the DoD that aliens don't exist
      2. Supporting their reputations or others in ufology
      3. trying to undermine trust in government, whether criminal conspiracy or just individual actions
2. David stretched the truth around how credible his sources were or fabricated sources, for any number of reasons
   1. Trying to create a career for himself in the industry of ufology
   2. Trying to shift the burden of proof to the DoD that aliens don't exist
   3. Trying to expose UAP programs that are everything he says they are, just not non human
   4. Try to undermine trust in government
3. David is telling the truth and there are non-human craft

I roughly estimate about 50%, 30%, and 20%. It would be 60%, 35%, 5% if not for the highly credible voices that seem to be vouching for it.

It's worth noting that in the newsnation interviews, David Grusch expressed 'i thought it was totally nuts'.  If there is evidence that prior to the task force he had a bias of believing in UFOs, this would be a serious contradiction to that important claim of impartiality.

It's also worth noting that [recent evidence has shown at least 100B planets](https://youtu.be/uGSAdNAWByk?t=212) in the Milky Way.  This would mean aliens are likely, with the only debate as to whether they can make it to our planet.  Such evidence indicates that we need to be more proactive about ensuring that aliens are not already here, and shifting the culture and burden of proof to the DoD to prove that aliens are not here, would be one way of doing that.
