I am skeptical of Grusch, because when he talks he doesn't caveat carefully about what he's been told is true versus what he's verified personally.  He also claims to want to be an 'opinion leader'.  

But I'm also fascinated by the chorus of reaonsably credible voices supporting him and/or his claims.  

For that reason, I am keeping an updated list of folks who vouch for either David, his claims, or both.

I believe most presidents have been circumspect in their denials around this.  Considering how often they lie to get elected though, not sure it's relevant either way. Carter is in hospice, and he once did promise that he would get the truth out to Americans, but walked it back after getting elected. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter_UFO_incident

If I am missing anyone here, let me know in issues.  I'll try to keep it updated as more voices show up.
