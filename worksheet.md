### Sarah has 23 apples, and she wants to divide them among her 5 friends such that each will get an equal amount of apples and she gets to keep twice as many as she hands out to each friend.   How many  apples are left over?  

1. Let x be the number of apples each friend gets. Then, Sarah would keep 2x apples.
2. We need to find a value for x that satisfies the total number of apples Sarah has, which is 23.
3. The equation for this problem is: 5x (apples for friends) + 2x (apples for Sarah) = 23
4. Solve for x: 5x + 2x = 23, 7x = 23
5. Since 23 is not divisible by 7, we cannot find an integer value for x that satisfies the equation. We can find the largest integer value of x that will leave some apples left over.
6. 23 / 7 = 3 with a remainder of 2
7. In this case, each friend would get 3 apples, and Sarah would keep 6 apples (2 * 3). There would be 2 apples left over.

So, the number of apples left over is 2.


### A store is offering a 15% discount on a jacket that originally costs $120. The store is also offering another 20% discount on pants that cost half of the jacket.  Jane has $200. How much will she have after buying both the jacket and the pants?

1. let's calculate the cost of the jacket after the 15% discount:
2. Original cost of the jacket: $120
3. Discount on the jacket: 15%
4. Cost of the jacket after the discount: $120 - (15% of $120)
5. $120 - (0.15 * $120)
6. $120 - $18
7. $102
8. Now, let's find the original cost of the pants:
9. Original cost of the pants: 1/2 * $120 = $60
10. Next, calculate the cost of the pants after the 20% discount:
11. Discount on the pants: 20%
12. Cost of the pants after the discount: $60 - (20% of $60)
13. = $60 - (0.20 * $60)
14. = $60 - $12
15. = $48
16. Now, let's find the total cost of both the jacket and the pants:
17. Total cost = $102 (jacket) + $48 (pants) = $150
18. Jane initially has $200. After buying both the jacket and the pants, she will have:
19. Remaining amount = $200 - $150 = $50

So, Jane will have $50 left after buying both the jacket and the pants.



### A recipe calls for 1/2 cup of sugar. John wants to make half of the recipe, but also another recipe which will take three times as much sugar.  If John only has enough sugar to make the second recipe in full but still wants to make half of the first recipe, what fraction of the second recipe can John make?

1. let's find out how much sugar John needs to make half of the first recipe:
2. 1/2 (recipe) * 1/2 (cup of sugar) = 1/4 cup of sugar
3. Now, let's determine the amount of sugar required for the second recipe. Since it takes three times as much sugar as the first recipe:
4. 3 * 1/2 (cup of sugar) = 3/2 cups of sugar
5. We know that John has enough sugar to make the second recipe in full. So, John has 3/2 cups of sugar.
6. Since John wants to make half of the first recipe, he will use 1/4 cup of sugar for that. To find out how much sugar he has left for the second recipe:
7. 3/2 (cups of sugar) - 1/4 (cup of sugar) = (6/4 - 1/4) (cup of sugar) = 5/4 cups of sugar
8. Now, we need to determine what fraction of the second recipe John can make with 5/4 cups of sugar. The full second recipe requires 3/2 cups of sugar:
9. (5/4) / (3/2) = (5/4) * (2/3) = 10/12 = 5/6
10. So, John can make 5/6 of the second recipe with the remaining sugar.


### The radius of a circle is 5 cm. Another circle has twice the area of the first circle.  What is the diameter of the second circle?  Explain it step by step.

1. Find the area of the first circle using the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Given that the radius of the first circle is 5 cm, the formula will be: A1 = π(5)^2.
2. Calculate the area of the first circle: A1 = 3.14159 * 25 ≈ 78.54 square centimeters.
3. Calculate the area of the second circle, which is twice the area of the first circle: A2 = 2 * A1 = 2 * 78.54 ≈ 157.08 square centimeters.
4. Use the area formula A = πr^2 to find the radius of the second circle. Rearrange the formula to solve for r: r = √(A/π). Plug in the value of A2: r = √(157.08/3.14159).
5. Calculate the radius of the second circle: r ≈ 7.07 cm.
6. To find the diameter of the second circle, multiply the radius by 2: Diameter = 2 * r = 2 * 7.07 ≈ 14.14 cm.

So, the diameter of the second circle is approximately 14.14 cm.


### If a bank account has an annual interest rate of 4% and a starting balance of $1,000, how much interest will be earned after 3 years?

1. Identify the given values: the initial balance is $1,000, the annual interest rate is 4%, and the number of years is 3.
2. Convert the annual interest rate to a decimal by dividing by 100: 4% / 100 = 0.04.
3. Use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^t, where A is the final amount, P is the principal (initial balance), r is the interest rate, and t is the number of years.
4. Plug in the values into the formula: A = 1000(1 + 0.04)^3.
5. Calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 1 + 0.04 = 1.04.
6. Raise the result to the power of 3: 1.04^3 ≈ 1.124864.
7. Multiply the result by the initial balance: 1000 * 1.124864 ≈ 1124.86.
8. Subtract the initial balance from the final amount to find the interest earned: 1124.86 - 1000 = $124.86.

So, the interest earned after 3 years is $124.86.




### In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability of drawing an ace or a spade?  Answer step by step

Step 1: Determine the number of aces and spades in the deck. There are 4 aces (one in each suit) and 13 spades (one for each rank in the spade suit).

Step 2: Subtract the overlapping card. Since there is 1 Ace of Spades, it is counted twice in the previous step (once as an ace and once as a spade). To avoid double-counting, subtract 1 from the total.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes. There are 4 aces + 13 spades - 1 overlapping card = 16 favorable outcomes.

Step 4: Determine the total number of possible outcomes. There are 52 cards in the deck, so there are 52 possible outcomes.

Step 5: Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes: Probability = 16/52.

Step 6: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4: 16/4 = 4, and 52/4 = 13. So, the probability is 4/13.

The probability of drawing an ace or a spade from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is 4/13.





### A train travels at a constant speed of 60 km/h until it reaches 9/10 of its journey , at which point it slows down to 30km/h.   How far is a completed journey that takes 4 hours?

Let the total distance of the journey be D km. We need to find the time spent at each speed and use that information to calculate the total distance.

Step 1: Find the distance for each portion of the journey.
For the first portion, the train covers 9/10 of the journey, so the distance is (9/10)D.
For the second portion, the train covers the remaining 1/10 of the journey, so the distance is (1/10)D.

Step 2: Calculate the time spent at each speed.
Let t1 be the time spent at 60 km/h and t2 be the time spent at 30 km/h.

Using the formula distance = speed × time:

For the first portion: (9/10)D = 60 × t1.
For the second portion: (1/10)D = 30 × t2.

Step 3: Use the given total time to create an equation for t1 and t2.
The total time is 4 hours, so t1 + t2 = 4.

Step 4: Solve for t1 in terms of D and substitute it into the equation for total time.

t1 = (9/10)D / 60.

Substituting into t1 + t2 = 4, we get:

((9/10)D / 60) + t2 = 4.

Step 5: Solve for t2 in terms of D and substitute it into the equation for the second portion of the journey.

t2 = 4 - ((9/10)D / 60).

Substituting into (1/10)D = 30 × t2, we get:

(1/10)D = 30 × (4 - ((9/10)D / 60)).

Step 6: Solve for D.

(1/10)D = 120 - (9/20)D.

Multiplying by 20 to eliminate the fractions:

2D = 2400 - 9D.

Adding 9D to both sides:

11D = 2400.

Dividing by 11:

D = 2400 / 11 ≈ 218.18 km.

The completed journey is approximately 218.18 kilometers.



### There are 2.54 cm in an inch. How many centimeters are in two lengths added together, where the first length is twice as long as the second length, and the second length is 3 inches.

Given that the second length is 3 inches and the first length is twice as long as the second length, the first length is 2 * 3 = 6 inches.

Now, we can convert the lengths from inches to centimeters using the conversion factor (1 inch = 2.54 cm).

First length in centimeters: 6 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 15.24 cm
Second length in centimeters: 3 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 7.62 cm

Finally, add the two lengths in centimeters together:

15.24 cm + 7.62 cm = 22.86 cm

So, when the two lengths are added together, they measure 22.86 centimeters.




### In a juice recipe, the ratio of oranges to apples is 3:5, the ratio of pears to apples is 6:2.   How much total fruit  do you need if you have 6 oranges?  explain the answer step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of apples.
Since the ratio of oranges to apples is 3:5 and you have 6 oranges, you need to find out how many apples correspond to this number of oranges.

(6 oranges) / (3 in the ratio) = 2
Now multiply the number of apples in the ratio by this factor:
2 * 5 (apples in the ratio) = 10 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of pears.
Since the ratio of pears to apples is 6:2, we can simplify this ratio:
6:2 = 3:1

Now we know that for every 1 apple, there are 3 pears. Since we have 10 apples:

3 (pears per apple) * 10 (apples) = 30 pears

Step 3: Calculate the total number of fruits.
Now, add the number of oranges, apples, and pears to find the total number of fruits:

6 oranges + 10 apples + 30 pears = 46 fruits

You need a total of 46 fruits for the juice recipe if you have 6 oranges.



### At a local park, a child throws a ball into the air. The ball's height (in meters) above the ground can be modeled by the  equation:  h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 20t + 1.5  where h(t) represents the height of the ball, and t represents the time (in seconds) since the ball was thrown.  The ball is traveling towards his friend at horizontal distance of d(t) = 0.5t, where d(t) is the distance in metres.  The friend standing 20 meters away, how many meters per second do they need to run to catch the ball at a height of 1 meter?

First, we need to find the time when the ball is at a height of 1 meter. To do this, we will use the equation h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 20t + 1.5 and set it equal to 1:

1 = -4.9t^2 + 20t + 1.5

Now, we need to solve this equation for t. Rearrange the equation:

0 = -4.9t^2 + 20t + 0.5

We will use the quadratic formula to solve for t:

t = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

where a = -4.9, b = 20, and c = 0.5.

t = (-20 ± sqrt(20^2 - 4*(-4.9)0.5)) / (2(-4.9))

t ≈ 0.102, 4.066

We discard the first solution (0.102 seconds) as it is too early and the friend wouldn't have time to react. So, we'll use t = 4.066 seconds.

Now, we need to find the horizontal distance the ball has traveled by that time using the equation d(t) = 0.5t:

d(4.066) = 0.5 * 4.066 ≈ 2.033 meters

Since the friend is standing 20 meters away, they need to cover a distance of 20 - 2.033 ≈ 17.967 meters.

Finally, we need to find the speed at which the friend must run to cover that distance in 4.066 seconds:

speed = distance / time
speed = 17.967 / 4.066 ≈ 4.42 m/s

The friend needs to run at a speed of approximately 4.42 meters per second to catch the ball at a height of 1 meter.



### In a right-angled triangle, the two shorter sides total up to 30 cm in length, with one side being 1/2 the length of the other.  What is the length of the hypotenuse?   Answer step by step.

Let the two shorter sides be x and y. Since one side is half the length of the other, let x = 2y. According to the problem, the sum of the two shorter sides is 30 cm:

x + y = 30 cm

Substitute x with 2y:

2y + y = 30 cm

Combine the terms:

3y = 30 cm

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 10 cm

Now we can find the length of the other side (x):

x = 2y = 2(10 cm) = 20 cm

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse (h):

x^2 + y^2 = h^2

(20 cm)^2 + (10 cm)^2 = h^2

400 + 100 = h^2

500 = h^2

Take the square root of both sides:

h = √500 ≈ 22.36 cm

So, the length of the hypotenuse is approximately 22.36 cm.



### The test scores of students are: 90, 80, 75, 90, 85, 35, 88, 59, 60, and 70. What is the median test score?  Answer step by step.

To find the median test score, first, arrange the test scores in ascending order:

35, 59, 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 88, 90, 90

Since there are 10 test scores (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle numbers. In this case, the two middle numbers are 75 and 80.

Now, find the average of these two numbers:

(75 + 80) / 2 = 155 / 2 = 77.5

So, the median test score is 77.5.


### In a class of 20 students with 12 girls and 8 boys, a committee of 4 students is to be chosen where there must be an equal number of boys and girls on each committee. How many different ways can the committee be formed?  Answer step by step.

To have an equal number of boys and girls on the committee, there must be 2 girls and 2 boys. We can use combinations to find the number of different ways to choose 2 girls from 12 girls and 2 boys from 8 boys.

Number of ways to choose 2 girls from 12 girls:
C(12,2) = 12! / (2! * (12-2)!) = 12! / (2! * 10!) = 66

Number of ways to choose 2 boys from 8 boys:
C(8,2) = 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = 8! / (2! * 6!) = 28

Now, multiply the number of ways to choose the girls by the number of ways to choose the boys to find the total number of ways to form the committee:

Total number of ways = 66 (ways to choose girls) * 28 (ways to choose boys) = 1848

So, there are 1848 different ways to form the committee with an equal number of boys and girls.


### A farmer has a rectangular plot of land that measures 200 meters by 400 meters. He wants to divide the plot into smaller equal-sized square sections. Each square section must have a side length that is a power of 2. What is the greatest possible side length (in meters) of each square section that the farmer can use to divide the plot, and how many square sections will there be in total?   Answer step by step.

To find the greatest possible side length of the square sections that is a power of 2, we need to find the greatest common factor of 200 and 400 that is also a power of 2.

The prime factors of 200 are: 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 (or 2^3 × 5^2)
The prime factors of 400 are: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 (or 2^4 × 5^2)

The greatest common factor that is a power of 2 is 2^3, which is 8. However, since the problem asks for the greatest side length that is a power of 2, we need to find the largest square that can be formed using the factors 2^3. The largest square that can be formed is 2^2 × 2^2, which has a side length of 2^2 = 4.

So, the greatest possible side length for each square section is 4 × 2 = 8 meters.

Now we need to find the total number of square sections. Divide the total area of the rectangular plot by the area of each square section:

Total area of the rectangular plot = 200 meters × 400 meters = 80,000 square meters
Area of each square section = 8 meters × 8 meters = 64 square meters

Number of square sections = Total area / Area of each square section = 80,000 / 64 = 1,250

So, the greatest possible side length of each square section is 8 meters, and there will be 1,250 square sections in total.
